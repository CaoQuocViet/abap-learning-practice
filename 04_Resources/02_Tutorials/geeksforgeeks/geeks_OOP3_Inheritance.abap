" Syntax of inheritance
CLASS sub_class DEFINITION INHERITING FROM super_class.

" Program
CLASS Parent_class DEFINITION.
    PUBLIC SECTION.
        METHODS: display REDEFINITION.
            DATA: data TYPE string.
ENDCLASS.

" Implementation of display method below
CLASS Parent_class IMPLEMENTATION.
    METHOD display.
        WRITE: / 'parent_data=', data.
    ENDMETHOD.

" Child_class inherited from parent_class.
CLASS Child_class DEFINITION INHERITING FROM Parent_class.
    PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHOD: display REDEFINITION.
        DATA: subclass_data TYPE string.
    ENDMETHOD
ENDCLASS.

" Implementation of child class
CLASS Child_class IMPLEMENTATION.

" Defining object references
DATA Parent_instance TYPE REF TO Parent_class.
DATA Child_instance TYPE REF TO Child_class.

" Instance for parent
CREATE OBJECT Parent_instance.
" Instance for child
CREATE OBJECT Child_instance.

" Attributes setup of base and derived class
Parent_instance -> data = 'This is Parent_data'.
Child_instance -> data = 'This is Child_data'.
Child_instance -> data = subclass_data = 'This is specific_child data'.

" Displaying data
CALL METHOD Parent_instance -> display.
CALL METHOD Child_instance -> display.

" Output:
" Parent_data=This is Parent_data
" Child_data=This is specific_child data

" Rules for Redefining method in Sub Class:
" Rule 1:- We have used the same method name (display) and return type (string) in the child class and parent class.
" Rule 2:- “REDEFINITION” keyword is used to redefine the method in child class.
" Rule 3:- Access control of parent class and child class is also same as shown in the code i.e. “PUBLIC”.

" Access control in inheritance
" Public:- The member which is declared public can be accessed from inside and outside the class.
" Protected:- The member which is defined as protected can be accessed within the class and it’s sub-class only.
" Private:- The member which is defined as private can be accessed with the class only.
